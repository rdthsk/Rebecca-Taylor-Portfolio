## Student Video Game Projects
### CALI REMIX
  The Gameheads Fellowship program provides grants and contracts to SAP teams who have both a strong game idea and development team structure so see the SAP demo developed into a full, released game. California 100 was a two year initiative from 2021-2023 focused on inspiring a vision and strategy for CA’s future for the next 100 years.
  A few months after the release of Camino, Team Bruja Bros and Gameheads collaborated with Cal 100 to create a piece of interactive media that would be on the Cal 100 website and serve as a way for visitors to learn more about the initiative and it’s plans,
  For CALI REMIX, I gained experience in developing a project for a customer, quickly modifying and adapting to changes in design, and deploying WebGL builds. Play CALI REMIX [here.](https://california100.org/cali-remix-game/)

### Camino
  Camino is a 2D side-scrolling stealth game with Afro-surrealist elements that challenge the player to carefully manage resources and make use of their environment to fight for their loved ones and survive the onslaught of colonization.
  Camino started as a project during GH SAP 2020 with myself and 5 other veteran Gameheads students. After SAP, the team was offered a contract to produce the full game through the Fellowship program. This then led to an additional contract with Google Play to port the game to Android and release the game on the platform. Camino was released on Google Play in March 2023 and stayed on the Play Store for a year. Camino was than released on Steam in Fall 2024
  For Camino, I handled many of the technical responsibilities. This included: Enemy AI using state machines, creating camera effects with Unity’s Cinemachine tool, gameplay programming, tools programming,  input handling, build automation, version control, crash and bug investigation, delegating tasks to my secondary programmer, using the Google Play Console, and porting the game to both Android and Steam.

### Te Amo Mama

  Te Amo Mamá is a 2D side scroller that exposes players to the (often underrepresented) experience of motherhood. Te Amo Mamá  follows a mother hen as she guides her newly hatched chick back to the nest. The game was inspired by the disparity of many games exploring themes of fatherhood, but not many exploring motherhood.
  For Te Amo Mamá, I created an input and audio manager, created cutscenes in Unity’s Timeline tool, started to create camera effects with Unity Cinemachine tool, and collaborated with animators on SFX.

### Pussy Punchout

  Pussy Punchout is a 2D beat 'em up game where you play as Pussy, the cat, who is trying to save her friends. Pussy Punchout is both a response to the #MeToo movement and a critique of the sexism and misogyny  found in old school arcade beat ‘em up games such as Double Dragon.
  This game was my first experience working with another programmer and programming a combat system. It was also my first time working on a game that was outside of the “normal” side scroller format in that Pussy Punchout is still in a 2D perspective, but uses 3D space. A unique challenge of the perspective was finding the right camera angle so that the objects in 3D space still appeared as 2D on camera.

### Unthanked Hero

  Unthanked Hero is a 2D side scrolling action adventure game that explores themes of workplace sexism through the story of a superhero’s Sidekick, Aisha, who is the one responsible for  all the heroic acts that the town “hero” Zac Myers swiftly takes all the credit for.
  The Unthanked Hero was my first time working on a game outside of the platformer genre and my first time prototyping not only one enemy, but multiple enemy types. This was also the project where I began to have an interest in gameplay/mechanics programming. Since the player was a superhero, we could have a bit of creativity with machines which lead to developing both a flying and a metal ability.

### LUCiD

  LUCiD is a 2D local Co-Op puzzle-platformer game about a temperamental boy named Maliki and a hopeless perfectionist named Samaya whose worlds collide after losing a mutual friend. LUCiD explores the first stage of grief, denial, in the demo level.
  LUCiD was my first experience working on a game development team on a long term basis. LUCiD was a challenge for me as a very young programmer since it was my first time working on a project with that many moving parts, such as having two independently controlled players and figuring out camera movement if either of the two players decided to wander away from the other. However, this project served as a teeth cutting project in that working on it prepared me for a lot of experiences I would have in the coming years.
